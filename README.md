## Unique value proposition

- The workshop materials helps to learn effectively.
- The editing requires only a text editor with Markdown and HTML syntax highlighting.
- The dependencies are maximum simple and robust to install.

## Dependencies

The following tools need to be installed before you can start using the tool:

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Getting started

To create new workshop materials, you can use the [Workshop Materials template](https://github.com/experimental-software/workshop-materials-template):

```
PROJECT_NAME=your-project-here
{
git clone --recurse \
  https://github.com/experimental-software/workshop-materials-template.git \
  $PROJECT_NAME

cd $PROJECT_NAME
git submodule update --remote
git remote remove origin
}

DEFAULT_BRANCH=main
{
git checkout --orphan $DEFAULT_BRANCH
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
}
```

Afterwards, refer to the README file of the new project, for hints what should be done next.
